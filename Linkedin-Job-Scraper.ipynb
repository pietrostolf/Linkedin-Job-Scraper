If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.Minimum RequirementsStrong technical background, including 2+ years of experience as a backend engineer, with an affinity for building scalable backend infrastructure.Experience delivering, extending, and maintaining large scale distributed systems.The skills to build holistically – from specs and documentation to implementation, testing, deployment, and measuring impactAbility to work well cross-functionally and earn trust from colleagues at all levelsThink about systems and services and write high quality code. We work mostly in Ruby, with some Scala and Go. However, languages can be learned: we care much more about your general engineering skill than knowledge of a particular language or framework.You hold yourself and others to a high bar when working with production systemsTake pride in working on projects to successful completion involving a wide variety of technologies and systems.Thrive in a collaborative environment involving different stakeholders and subject matter expertsEnjoy working with a diverse group of people with different expertise (for example, ¼ of Stripes work in a country that’s different from the one they grew up in).Almost every role at Stripe collaborates with some engineers, from Sales and Support in sharing feedback from our customers; to Legal and Accounting in supporting our systems for tracking money movement and reporting around the world.Preferred QualificationsPropensity to ask questions, assume good intentions, and defaulting to transparencyYou hold yourself and others to a high bar when working with production systemsYou think of yourself as entrepreneurial and enjoy moving quickly on new, green-field products.Hybrid work at StripeThis role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.Pay and benefitsThe annual salary range for this role in the primary location is C$134,400 - C$201,600. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process. Benefits/additional compensation for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; retirement plans; health benefits; and wellness stipends.\\n        \\n\\n\\n        \\n            Show more\\n          \\n\\n          \\n\\n\\n\\n        \\n            Show less\\n          \\n\\n          \\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n            Seniority level\\n          \\n\\n            Mid-Senior level\\n          \\n\\n\\n\\n            Employment type\\n          \\n\\n            Full-time\\n          \\n\\n\\n\\n              Job function\\n            \\n\\n              Engineering and Information Technology\\n            \\n\\n\\n\\n              Industries\\n            \\n\\n            Software Development, Financial Services, and Technology, Information and Internet\\n            \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nReferrals increase your chances of interviewing at Stripe by 2x\\n\\n                See who you know', 'url': 'https://www.linkedin.com/jobs-guest/jobs/api/jobPosting/3982095998'}\n",

      "{'company': 'Stripe', 'job-title': 'Full Stack Engineer, Connect', 'level': 'Mid-Senior level', 'description': 'Who we areAbout StripeStripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.About The TeamConnect enables the world’s leading platforms and marketplaces like Shopify, DoorDash, and Instacart to incorporate payments into their products. Connect has been at the forefront of Stripe’s growth due to the power of its offering, which enables our users to distribute Stripe’s payment processing directly to their sellers and merchants. As Stripe grows its suite of product offerings beyond payments, Connect will unlock a new phase of growth for Stripe by enabling our platforms to distribute all of Stripe’s products to their end users. Multiple teams within Connect are hiring full stack engineers.What you’ll doResponsibilitiesBuild end-to-end experiences for Connect that make it as easy as possible to participate in the Internet economy and receive money online. Some of Stripe’s largest users are platforms that connect senders of payments with receivers of payments. Lyft connects riders to drivers, Kickstarter connects backers to projects, and Squarespace connects shoppers to online stores. All of them participate in doing business online, and all of them use Connect.Make it easy for Connect platforms to scale their business through leveraging the full power of Stripe’s products via the dashboard, adding to their business models and product functionality while reducing integration lift and complexity.Build great product experiences (integrate with Instant Payouts, Issuing, Capital, Terminal, etc) into all of Connect’s dashboard surfaces.Who you areWe’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role.

This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.Pay and benefitsThe annual salary range for this role in the primary location is C$134,400 - C$201,600. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process. Benefits/additional compensation for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; retirement plans; health benefits; and wellness stipends.\\n        \\n\\n\\n        \\n            Show more\\n          \\n\\n          \\n\\n\\n\\n        \\n            Show less\\n          \\n\\n          \\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n            Seniority level\\n          \\n\\n            Mid-Senior level\\n          \\n\\n\\n\\n            Employment type\\n          \\n\\n            Full-time\\n          \\n\\n\\n\\n              Job function\\n            \\n\\n              Engineering and Information Technology\\n            \\n\\n\\n\\n              Industries\\n            \\n\\n            Software Development, Financial Services, and Technology, Information and Internet\\n            \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nReferrals increase your chances of interviewing at Stripe by 2x\\n\\n                See who you know', 'url': 'https://www.linkedin.com/jobs-guest/jobs/api/jobPosting/3949889008'}\n",
